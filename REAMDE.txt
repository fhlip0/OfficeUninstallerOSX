current usage is as such
tested working on macOS 10.12 and Office 2016 and 2011


copy via LogMeIn file manager to /Users/shared 
 -log into Remote Support or other Admin account (MUST be admin)
  -open terminal (i showed using spotlight and just searching in my demo for ease)
  -run "cd ../Shared" no quotes
  -run "sudo python ./officeuninstall.py" 

-script will ask if you want to uninstall office 2011 or 2016.

-it will then take care of removing it from Applications, backend Library folders, and Preferences

-Finally it will ask if you want to clear the dock of any Office applications and restart the dock




It is recommened to reboot prior to installing a new version of Office after this.
