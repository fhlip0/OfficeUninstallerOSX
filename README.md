# OfficeUninstallerOSX


Office Uninstaller I threw together to fill a gap left my microsoft for Office 2016 on macs.

This is a simple rm python script that takes care of the same work noted in https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3

-also with some code from https://github.com/jcarm010/osx-dock-remover that clears the dock of icons as well -

-usage is to download - use Terminal to cd to the directory - then run with "sudo python ./officeuninstall.py"
  -it will ask if you are uninstalling 2011 or 2016 - then remove the appropriate files 
    -will then ask if you want to clear the dock Office icons
	
	
	please let me know of any issues / concerns - i have tested on 10.12 and thats about it - - but since its so basic, it should be fine
